# twiiterbot
A python way to follow, unfollow and tweet tweets.

Idea:
Bot follows random twitter users and after a while unfollows them. Requests are made within Twitter API limits. Supports multiple accounts.

Bot ran on Raspberry Pi Zero autonomously for 30+ days. People gets notification and possibly follows back.
Followers gathered totally around ~2k per account (was tested with 5).

Not the most moral application.
